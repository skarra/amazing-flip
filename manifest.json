// This is a small Chrome extension that solves a minor pain point of
// mine: I buy a lot of books on Flipkart, but usually the quantum and
// quality of reviews on the site leave something to be desired. To
// make up for this I often lookup the same book on Amazon to take in
// the reviews. With this extension installed, a new item will appear
// when you right click on a link while you are on flipkart.com - and
// you can just click that to bring up a amazon.com page for that book
//
